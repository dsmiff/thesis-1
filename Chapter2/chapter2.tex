%********************************** % First Section  *************************************
\section{Introduction}  %Section - 1.1 
\label{sec:theory_intro}

The Standard Model, proposed in 1970s, has long 

- Goal of particle physics: blah (put in intro?)
- standard model
- very successful
    - predictive power - predicted many particles before they were discovered
    - withstands great scrutiny from precision ewk measurements
- we know it's missing significant details
- fails to explain some fundamental observations of the universe
- need something better
    - use as a low energy approximation within a larger, more complete model
    - enter SUSY

\section{Current understanding}
\label{sec:theory_current}
talk about development
based on fundamental symmetries of space time
great theory
mention last missing piece of the puzzle - scalar particle responsible to EWSB

\subsection{Fundamental Forces of Nature}
self explanatory

\subsection{Particle Content of the Standard Model}
Go through the normal table of particles, explaining each section and how the relate 
to historic experimental observations.

\subsection{Failings of the Standard Model}
Overview

Main focus of section. Need to motivate beyond the standard model theories

Here mention gravity? No dedicated subsubsection?

\subsubsection{The Heirarchy Problem}
\subsubsection{Dark Matter/Energy}


%********************************** % Second Section  *************************************
\section{Overview of Supersymmetry}  %Section - 1.2
\label{sec:theory_overview}
Overview. A basic introduction.

Super-multiplets.

a broken symmetry

R-parity

solution to the heirarchy problem - loop corrections etc

\subsection{The Minimally Supersymmetric Standard Model}
talk about `Complete models'

mention the free parameters of the MSSM (hint at how they're eventually 
constrained within other models)

briefly mention the various symmetry breaking models - relation to visible/hidden sector 
etc.


\subsection{Simplified Model Spectra}
Overview. Signature vs model interpretations.

allow for theorists to easily interpret within their favoured complete model

allow easy comparison between various experimental searches.

\subsubsection{vs `Complete' models}
% \subsubsection{Gluino production and decay - only if needed for T1ttcc}

\subsection{Stop quark production and decay}
go through the various decay channels of the stop in the mStop vs mLSP plane
- which are relevant where

\subsection{Mass-degeneracy in SUSY}
Overview of the small deltaM region. Different area of phase space than many searches due to soft decay 
products.

currently largely inacessible

stop mass degeneracy line/gap

\subsubsection{Relevant Models}
Make link to the above section about stop decay channels

Why only relevant here?
- dark matter constraints - DM co-annihilation etc
- off-shell W

relic density is fulfilled in this region. omegah2

\subsubsection{Phenomenology}
briefly cover this with some poinient plots from early T2cc studies

MAY HAVE THIS HERE OR LATER
\subsubsection{Current Limits}

\subsection{Targetted models}
Full list with some minor comments and feynman diagrams

Currently: T2cc, T2degen, (maybe T1ttcc)
