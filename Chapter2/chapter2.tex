\section{Introduction}  %Section - 1.1 
\label{sec:theory_intro}

The Standard Model (SM), proposed in 1970s, has long been the most prominent and 
successful description of fundamental particles and their interactions at the
energies currently experimentally accessible. It's predictive power has been proven with the 
theoretical description of particles such as the charm and top quarks, and the W and
Z bosons, prior to their experimental observation. Furthermore, precision 
electroweak measurement \emph{SUCH AS...} have shown impressive levels of 
agreement with SM predictions \emph{REF}.

However, despite it's great success, it is known to only be valid for low 
energies, and is missing significant details of both experimentally 
observed and theoretically predicted physical phenomena. As such, extensions to
the SM have been extensively studied, assuming the SM to be a low-energy 
regime within a greater theory. One such strongly theoretically motivated extension 
to the SM is Supersymmetry (SUSY).

This chapter outlines the SM model, including it's particle content and basic 
mechanisms, before going on to describe it's shortcomings - the theoretical 
motivation for theories Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). SUSY will then be 
introduced, before moving on to it's simplest forms, and finally a discussion of
the specific models and frameworks used for interpretation within this analysis.

\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:theory_current}
The Standard Model is a Quantum Field Theory describing the fundamental 
matter particles and their interactions via the fundamental strong, weak and 
electromagnetic forces. It was collaboratively developed over the 1960's, with
it's current form being finalised in the mid-1970s.

based on fundamental symmetries of space time



\emph{Fundamental Forces of Nature}
of the four fundamental forces, the standard model includes descriptions of the 
weak, strong and electromagnetic forces as part of the quantum field theory 
description.

SU(3) for strong interactions via colour charge, SU(2) for weak isospin and U(1) 
for weak hypercharge.

the requirement that the SM lagrangian be invariant under local gauge 
transformations determines the structure of the model...

\emph{Particle Content of the Standard Model}
% Go through the normal table of particles, explaining each section and how the relate 
% to historic experimental observations.

FERMIONS

matter particles are described by spin 1/2 fermions, divided into the six quarks and six 
leptons. the quarks are arranged in three generations, the up and down, the charm
and strange, and the top and bottom, carrying electric charges of +2/3 and -1/2 
respectively. the quarks also carry a colour charge, where only colour-neutral 
composite hadron particles, combinations of quarks, are seen in nature.

the leptons again are arrange in three generations, constructed from SU(2) 
doublets of weak isospin (neutrino L, l)L of left-handed states, and singlets of
lR right-handed states, where l represents the electron, muon and tau, each with
-1 electric charge. with vl being their corresponding electrically neutral neutrinos.

BOSONS
interactions between the fermions are mediated by spin-1 bosons. the strong 
force, represented by eight electrically neutral, massive, colour-charged 
gluons. the electroweak force being mediated by the electrically neutral, 
massless photon (gamma), the massive, neutral Z0, and the massive, electrically 
charged W+- bosons.

finally, the electroweak sector, SU(2)xU(1) is spontaneously broken by the 
massive, neutral, spin-0 scalar boson H0, allowing for massive particles to 
attain mass. couples in proportion to mass.

\emph{does it give masses to every massive particle, or just W/Z and this 
propogates mass?}
