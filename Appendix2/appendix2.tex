\chapter{\dphistar requirement in the signal region}

Outline details of studies for applying the \dphistar requirement in the
signal region.

What kind of events are we kicking out?

How well does this work?

can show the QCD MG MC plots of \dphistar and maybe discuss the different ways 
of calculating the variable (i.e. ``acceptedJets'' vs normal)

Can we really get away with not applying it in the control regions?
    Maybe could show that the preds don't really change much

How much do we `lose' in signal efficiency? Show signal efficiency difference 
plots
