\chapter{\dphistar requirement in the signal region}

\emph{Outline details of studies for applying the \dphistar requirement in the
signal region.}

\emph{What kind of events are we kicking out?} targets events containing
mis-measured jets which contribute significantly to the missing energy of the
system.

\emph{How well does this work?} Very well! Removes all remaining QCD events that
contain missing energy. \emph{What about the remaining few QCD MG events at high
dPhiStar?}

can show the QCD MG MC plots of \dphistar - see peak around zero for QCD, even
after full selection and alphaT cuts. Can show without data...! Still though,
what about the handful of events at higher dphistar?

Can we really get away with not applying it in the control regions?
    Maybe could show that the preds don't really change much

\emph{How much do we `lose' in signal efficiency?} Show signal efficiency
difference plots, with vs without.

ultimately used to reject events with genuine missing energy coming from a jet.
heavy flavour mesons decaying leptonically, producing neutrinos. Could even show
an event display and/or event chain.

Would be good to include alphaT evolution plots, but these indicate a large
excess has been present...
