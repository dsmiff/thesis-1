Chapter 4
Objects
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- look up and briefly describe jet corrections.
- look up delatBeta corrections 
- look up and describe rho PU corrections
- placeholders and entries for references
- what is sigma_ietaieta?
- add ID effs? probably should...
- do rest of descriptions in the electron ID table
- define type-I corrections for PFMet
- find SIT ID ref for single lepton susy search

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Chapter 5
AlphaT analysis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- add in some alphaT correlation plots for various background sources/signal
etc
- put in a section showing some example data/MC distros. need to explain shit 
normalisation
- need to add a little more about had preselection. met filters etc?
- background breakdown in graph form
- do entire fake MET section - describe the background, it's sources and what we
do about it, with our various cuts
- maybe take away the diff turnons and keep the cumu
- fix titles in turn on curve plots - remove? crop each?
- formula method section
- describe MC generation - can get from AN
- add QCD MG samples to samples list
- add section about T2_4body boost corrections
- add section about ISR reweighting

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Chapter 6
Background est
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- introduction paragraph
- MJ background estimation systematics???
- final column in prescaled trig eff table???
- check what susy phase space screws MC normalisation
- reword table and figure titles
- add some more detail on level of closure from const and linear fit results
- read through and maybe summarise the extra section in AN about BG systs 
conservatism
- remove paragraph indentations for text after equations
