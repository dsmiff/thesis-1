AlphaT analysis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- add in some alphaT correlation plots for various background sources/signal
etc
- put in a section showing some example data/MC distros. need to explain shit 
normalisation
- need to add a little more about had preselection. met filters etc?
- background breakdown in graph form
- do entire fake MET section - describe the background, it's sources and what we
do about it, with our various cuts
- finish trigger section
- why are trig eff subfigures not side by side?
- formula method section
- describe MC generation - can get from AN
- add QCD MG samples to samples list
- add section about T2_4body boost corrections

Chapter 6
Background est
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- introduction paragraph
- do section on MHTMET MJ background estimation
- check what susy phase space screws MC normalisation
- details of control sample selections
- reword table and figure titles
- add some more detail on level of closure from const and linear fit results
- read through and maybe summarise the extra section in AN about BG systs 
conservatism
- fix mu trig eff table to get rid of mujets title
