\section{Introduction}  %Section - 1.1 
\label{sec:objects_introduction}
What is an object in CMS?

Physics objects are observed as energy deposits in the various detector 
subsystems throughout the CMS detector. Specific definitions for the different 
objects are provided by the Physics Object Groups (POGs) and are used in this 
analysis. The follow sections describe the objects used.

\section{Jets}  %Section - 1.2
\label{sec:objects_jets}
calojets used exclusively in analysis

Jets are produced when a single quark or gluon is produced, subsequently 
hadronizing and showering throughout the calorimeter systems. Energy deposits in
the hadronic calorimeter are clustered using the anti$-k_T$ algorithm [ref] with
a 0.5 cone size parameter. The raw energy measurements can be affected by 
effects from overlapping pp collisions, known as pileup (PU) [first place 
mentioned?], therefore corrections are made to account for this. Clustered jets 
are also corrected to establish a uniform response in $\eta$ and pT [mathchange].
Table~\ref{tab:jet_id_loose} summarises the ID requirements used in this 
analysis, which correspond to the ``Loose'' working point [ref]. Jets are also 
corrected according to the L1FastJet, L2, L3, and L2L3Residual corrections [ref].

\subsection{Tagging jets from b-quarks}
discuss the basic tagging algorithm used and working points

Jets originating from b-quarks can be identified using information from the 
vertex detector due to their increased lifetime with respect to light-quarks (u,
d, s, c). 
B-tagging algorithms are designed to determine the probability that a jet 
originates from a b-quark, given the jet's tracks displacement from the primary 
vertex (PV). Each algorithm considers the event's hadronic topology and 
calculates a value used to discriminate between a jet from a b-quark and a light
-quark.

The Combined Secondary Vertex (CSV) algorithm is used in this analysis,
using the ``Medium'' working point, or a discriminate value of $>0.679$. This 
working point corresponds to a mistag rate for gluons/light-quarks of 1\%, and a
pT dependent efficiency in the range of 60-70\% (plot?) [refs].
