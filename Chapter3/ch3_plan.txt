LHC
    - centre of mass energy
    - part of the accelerator complex
    - how does it accelerate protons?
        - RF cavities - what freq?
        - dipole magnets to bend them
            - what material?
            - what strength?
            - cooled to what temperature with what current?
    - Run I conditions - what bunch spacing?
    - Collisions delivered in 4 points around the accelerator ring
        - ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb
        - What PU did ATLAS and CMS have in Run I?
    - "successful running"

CMS
    - Hermetic calorimeter system
        - emphasise it's coverage
        - dimensions, mass
        - active dimensions of the system (where's the)
    - general goals of such a detector
        - generic searches for new physics - focus on high pT objects
        - provide accurate measurements of physics objects, such as...
        - can also investigate some mixing and lead-lead, p-lead phenomena

    - Consists of multiple detector subsystems
        - Solenoid Magnet
            - 
        - Pixels and tracker
            - 
        - ECAL
        - HCAL
        - Muon chambers
