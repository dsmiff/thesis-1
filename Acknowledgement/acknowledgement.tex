As I sit here in my kitchen, after having read my thesis for what feels like
the
thousandth time, I'm left with the intimidating task of writing these final
words - intimidating because there is no possible way I can portray enough my
incredible gratitude to the countless number of people that have helped me
get to the point I find myself in today. But let's give it a shot anyway.

Firstly, I would like to thank the many people I have had the pleasure of
working with
over the past three and half years. In particular those in
the RA1 team, notably Darren Burton, Yossof Eshaq, Edward
Laird, Bryn Mathias and Zhaoxia Meng, each for the seemingly unending patience
and help
they've shown me throughout my work especially in my early days. Of course, it
is to Rob Bainbridge that I
owe an incredible deal - not only for his constant guidance and supervision
throughout our work together, but also for what is quite possibly the longest
Skype conversation history since the dawn of the internet.
I also extend a great deal of thanks to my supervisor Henning Flaecher for
helping me throughout my PhD with continual support and challenging discussions.
Also for the seemingly vast number of thesis iterations and corrections, I'm
considerably grateful.

My fellow PhD students with whom I've experienced both the highs and lows of
the PhD experience, and have always been there to bring me back around with a
laugh
and a beer. Especially Robin Aggleton, Emyr Clement, Sam Harnew, Jeson Jacob,
Donal Hill
and Daniel Souza - I thank you.

Also I am incredibly grateful to the many friends and house mates that have
helped me, likely without even realising the importance of their actions, by
providing such a welcome and great relief from the research world. There are
far too many of you to name, but I'm sure you know who you are.

Of course, I couldn't go a whole round of thanks without mentioning the big man
himself, Allan `Ken' Lehan. For the far too many evenings spent
drinking far too many whiskies and chain-watching far too many episodes of The
Wire, I am hugely grateful (despite most of Season 3 still being but a hazy
memory). I take back everything I've ever said - you're alright.

Finally, I would like to extend the greatest of thanks to my family, without whom
I simply wouldn't be in the position I am, or the person I've become today.
There's not a day goes by that I'm not thankful to have such incredible parents
who have encouraged and believed in me always, without fail.
For your incredible, never-ending love and support I will be perpetually in debt
to you.
