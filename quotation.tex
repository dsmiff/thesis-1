  The work of basic scientists like Hertz, \\
  Dobson, and Kaplan can only be driven \\
  by curiosity, not purpose. \\
  What is the value of a particular curiosity? \\
  There is no way to know in advance. \\
  Discovery is curiosity’s product; everything else, \\
  including immeasurable economic value, follows. \\
  We cannot know the worth of something \\
  we have not yet discovered. \\
  The joy is the rainbow, \\
  not the hope of gold at the rainbow’s end.}\par\bigskip
