\label{sec:contribution}

Unless stated otherwise, the work presented in this thesis is that of the authors, 
or at least where the author was a major contributor. Specifically, the author's
unique contributions have been the implementation and validation of the Single
Isolated Track veto (Section~\ref{sec:selec_crit}); many preceding feasibility studies 
nto the study of the charm
and four-body stop decay scenarios, including the phenomenological studies of these
models presented in Section~\ref{sec:phenomenology}; early trigger studies, particularly
of the Parked trigger; the studies leading to the
isolation and cleaning of residual QCD contributions from semi-leptonic heavy flavour
decays (Section~\ref{sec:qcd_cleaning}); the general cross-checking of the analysis
using the closure test method (Section~\ref{sec:closure_tests}); the
development and implementation of the signal systematic measurement (Section~\ref{sec:interpretation_acceptance} and
\ref{sec:interpretation_uncertainties}); and the final
limit setting (Section~\ref{sec:interpretation_limits}. The author has been the
main contributor to the running of all analysis steps, with the exception of the
final trigger efficiency measurements.
