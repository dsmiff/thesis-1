\label{sec:contribution}
This work was carried out in collaboration
with the Imperial College and Bristol Universtiy SUSY groups, building on previous
publications. Unless stated otherwise, the work presented in this thesis is that
of the authors, or at least where the author was a major contributor. Specifically,
the author's unique contributions have been many preceding feasibility studies 
into the interpretation with charm
and four-body stop decay scenarios, including the phenomenological studies of these
models presented in Section~\ref{sec:phenomenology}; early trigger studies, particularly
regarding the Parked trigger; the studies leading to the
isolation and cleaning of residual QCD contributions from semi-leptonic heavy flavour
decays (Section~\ref{sec:qcd_cleaning}); the implementation and validation of the Single
Isolated Track veto (Section~\ref{sec:selec_crit}); the general cross-checking of the analysis
using the closure test method (Section~\ref{sec:closure_tests}); the
development and implementation of the signal systematic measurement (Section~\ref{sec:interpretation_acceptance} and
\ref{sec:interpretation_uncertainties}); and the final
SUSY model limit setting (Section~\ref{sec:interpretation_limits}). The author has been the
main contributor to the running of all analysis steps, with the exception of the
final trigger efficiency measurements.
