A search for Supersymmetry in the jets and missing energy final state is
described using the CMS detector at the LHC, and the full 19.7 \fb dataset
of
$\sqrt{s} = 8$ \tev proton-proton collisions. The search makes use of the
kinematic variable, \alphat, to reduce contributions from QCD multijet
processes by many orders of magnitude, down to a negligible level. Remaining
background sources originate from electroweak decays of heavy bosons and top
quarks, and are
estimated using a data-driven technique employing dedicated control regions. To
maintain sensitivity to a broad range of potential manifestations
of Supersymmetry, the analysis categorises events in dimensions of the scalar
sum of hadronic energy, the number of jets and the number of jets originating
from b-quarks. 
No statistically significant excess is observed and as such the results are
interpretted within the context of decays of stop particles to charm quarks and
via 4-body decays to fermions,
those specifically relevant in the mass-degenerate region of Supersymmetric
phase space. Limits are placed on $m_{\sTop}$ up to 275 GeV for the charm decay
and 250 GeV for the 4-body decay.
Natural units ($\hbar = c = 1$) are used thoughout this work.
