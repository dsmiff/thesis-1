A search for Supersymmetry in the jets and missing energy final state is
described using the CMS detector at the LHC, and the full 19.7 \fb dataset
of
$\sqrt{s} = 8$ \tev proton-proton collisions. The search makes use of the novel
kinematic variable, \alphat, to reduce contributions from QCD multijet
processes by many orders of magnitude, down to a negligible level. Remaining
background sources originate from electroweak decays of heavy bosons, and are
estimated using a data-driven technique employing dedicated control regions.
No statistically significant excess is observed and as such the results are
interpretted within the context of decays of stop particles,
specifically those relevant in the mass-degenerate region of Supersymmetric
phase space.
