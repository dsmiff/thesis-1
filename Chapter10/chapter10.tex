\emph{When I do actually write this, it's going to be really, really great.}

% Please give me a phd. I've done all this work. I didn't just ride my bike.

A search for Supersymmetry in the jets and missing energy final state has been
presented.

\emph{supersymmetry recap}

\emph{how we searched for it}

\emph{analysis - alphat, qcd reduction. correlates various variables, allowing
for a sliding mht threshold...?}

\emph{three dimensions}

\emph{signal triggers populate the signal region}

\emph{detailed study of any remaining residual QCD backgrounds}

\emph{ewk predicted from sidebands. how this method works. adjoint control
regions and transfer factors.}

\emph{relevant systematics are determined from a statistically powerful suite
of closure tests, each probing different facets of the analysis.}

\emph{results are determined via a simultaneous fit using an extensive
likelihood model}

\emph{no statistically significant excesses were observed - everything
compatible with fluctuations}

\emph{interpretations made in terms of two different decay channels of the stop
particle, relevant at low mass splittings (mass degenerate scenarios)}

\emph{strong, competitive limits produced}
