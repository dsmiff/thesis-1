\section{Set the scene of particle physics and the LHC}

Introduce the goal of science. The scientific method.

Our instinctive method of understanding is reductive - the cliched image of a
young inventor attempting to make sense of the things around them, is
that of endless toasters, clocks radios, or even gearboxes broken down into
their smallest constituent parts to better understand what they're made of and,
ultimately, what's happening inside of them. This simple idea translates almost
too perfectly to explain what Particle Physicists have been attempting to do
with not simple everyday household objects, but the Universe.

Since the beginnings of the field in YEAR, physicists have questioned
what is
around us, and what it's made of. From Fermi developing his ground-breaking
model of the atom, to Rutherford discovering it's structure, 

Purest form - understand things from the ground, up.
    in the same way to understand how a clock works, you instinctively look
    inside, so do we with the universe

Talk about the goal of particle physics.
    An understanding and description of the most fundamental particles, their 
    properties and interactions.

brief history of theory - going from waaaay back, with things like the
development of the atomic model, even as far back as caloric?

more recently - intersection of quantum mechanics and relativity

STANDARD MODEL

but we know its not the final picture. big holes.

particle physics has developed through a cat and mouse game of theorists and
experimentalists trying to keep up with each others progress

\section{SUSY}
one theory we're looking to find evidence of is susy. can fill many of the holes
of the standard model.
of the many ways to search for susy, hadronic channels prove to be an excellent
arena for early discovery at hadronic machines like the LHC.


while perhaps the theories and techniques discussed and described in this thesis
may become outdated, the spirit of discovery and the quest for a deeper
understanding of the underlying nature of the universe must never change.

we now find ourselves in a historically familiar position in that, thanks t
o the LHC, we're standing
at the edge of the energy frontier, peering into the unknown.
