Our instinctive method of understanding is reductive - the idea of an
inventor attempting to make sense of the things around them, is
that of toasters, clocks radios, or even gearboxes broken down into
their smallest constituent parts to better understand what they're made of and,
ultimately, what's happening inside of them. This simple idea translates
perfectly to explain the work Particle Physicists have been undertaking with
not simple everyday household objects, but the Universe.

Since the beginnings of the field, physicists have questioned
what is
around us, and what it's made of. From the early research of scientists such as
Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, the basic building
blocks of the universe have been searched for. For Particle Physicists, this is
the ultimate goal - a complete understanding of the nature of the Universe
at it's most
fundamental level. If a description can be written of the smallest
building blocks of
nature and how they interact, then ultimately we can understand
the Universe from the ground up.

Currently, our best attempt comes from the intersection of two very different
fields: Quantum Mechanics, the study of microscopic objects, and Relativity, the
study of very fast objects. The combination of these
two contrasting worlds gave birth to the field of Relativistic
Quantum Mechanics, and ultimately, the Standard Model.

First proposed in the 1960s, the Standard Model attempts to describe the
properties of the fundamental constituents of matter, and outline their
interactions through three of the four fundamental forces of nature, as
described in chapter~\ref{ch:theory}. Through
it's accurate description and predictions of not only particles such as
the electrons, quarks and gluons of which atoms are composed,
as well as fundamental constants of nature such as the fine structure constant
$\alpha$, the
Standard Model has exceptionally proven itself to be a triumph of
modern physics.

Despite it's continued accuracy in the face of substantial scrutiny, however,
the Standard Model fails to account for significant observations, for example
the absent description of gravity and the `other' 96\% of particles in the
Universe - the so-called `Dark Universe'. Similarly the Standard Model fails to
unify the forces at some higher mass scale, or accurately predict the mass of
the newly
discovered Higgs boson. As such, given how successfully it describes what it
can, the SM is widely considered
as a smaller component of some greater, all-encompassing theory.
This belief has led many to use this distinct theory as a building
block, on which extensions can be introduced to create Beyond the Standard Model
(BSM) theories - the goal being to fix the gaps in knowledge left by the SM.

Of the plethora of BSM theories, one particularly well motivated extension is
Supersymmetry (SUSY). The so-called `Supersymmetric' extension to the Standard
Model introduces supersymmetryic particles (or `sparticles') differing from
their SM partners by half a unit of spin - described in greater detail in
chapter~\ref{ch:theory}. The addition of sparticles fixes
many of the Standard Models problems, most notably that of the
divergent Higgs Mass and, crucially, provides a feasible
candidate particle for the elusive Dark Matter observed in abundance in the
Universe.

Particle physics as a field has developed largely via a cat and mouse game,
played out between theorists and experimentalists. While theoretical physicists
have
developed new theories and new particles, experimentalists have raced to build
greater and more advanced experiments with which to test them, and vice-versa.
Today, thanks to the incredibly hard work of thousands of physicists and
engineers, we are able to test such BSM theories with the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.

The LHC, described in detail in chapter~\ref{ch:detector}, is a 27 km
circumference proton synchrotron, capable of colliding protons
at centre-of-mass energies far exceeding any previous experiment.
Using the LHC, we can reproduce the conditions observed a short time
after the Big Bang, where the incredibly high energies present were able to
produce countless particles that wouldn't be visible in today's universe. If
such exotic particles are created in the proton-proton collisions performed at
the LHC, it is the goal of experiments such as the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
to detect them.

The CMS detector, also described in chapter~\ref{ch:detector}, is comprised of
multiple sub-detector systems, each designed
specifically to make precise measurements of the characteristics of the
different particles created. The detector is built such that it provides almost
complete hermetic coverage to detect particles travelling in all directions
from the point of collision. Through the study of global momentum imbalances,
the presence of weakly interacting particles can be inferred - a key technique
for searches for SUSY.

If sparticles were to be produced at the LHC they would immediately decay to
many well-understood SM particles, and finally the weakly interacting `Lightest
Supersymmetric Particle' (LSP), the theory's Dark Matter candidate. Of the many
different possible supersymmetric decays, hadronic channels offer the largest
branching fractions, although can present some of the most difficult experiment
challenges. Hadronic searches are of interest given their simple and relatively
quick ability to provide sensitivity to early discover at hadronic colliders
like the LHC.

The work described in this thesis consists of such a search for SUSY particles
decaying to quarks and missing-energy. The biggest obstacle to
searching for hadronic signatures of new physics, is dealing with the huge
(better word) hadronic backgrounds from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
interactions. In this
analysis a powerful kinematic variable, \alphat, is used to differentiate
between QCD and potential signal events. The analysis backgrounds, selection and
the \alphat variable are described at length in chapter~\ref{ch:analysis}. The
remaining SM sources of background
are estimated using a data-driven transfer technique from dedicated control
samples, orthogonal to the search region - as outlined in
chapter~\ref{ch:background}.

Given the vast number of potential manifestations of SUSY, many different forms
could theoretically be realised in nature. Accordingly, this analysis
categorises events into dimensions of three different event-level variables,
the results for which are given in chapter~\ref{ch:results}.
Specific analysis categories can therefore be used to produce targeted
interpretations of different potential final states, thereby maintaining a broad
sensitivity to SUSY production, however may present itself in nature. In this
thesis,
interpretations are shown for two different decay channels of the \sTop
sparticle, and limits produced in terms of the \sTop mass. These interpretations
and discussions of the related efficiencies and systematics are presented in
chapter~\ref{ch:interpretation}, before final conclusions are made in
chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion}.

The analysis presented in this thesis is one of many such searches for
Supersymmetry performed at the LHC, each with the goal of understanding better
the nature of the largest scale objects of the Universe, by studying it's
smallest.
